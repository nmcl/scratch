I began working on this around February/March 2020 as Coronavirus was taking hold. Grand plans to model different approaches to isolation, infections etc. At the time I had no intention of dedicating this code to anyone as I don't think I've ever done that before. However, when my mother, Elizabeth Little, was taken from us by coronavirus on May 12th 2020 that changed. A small gesture but it'll stay here for posterity:

**Dedicated to Elizabeth Little, born May 6th 1947, died May 12th 2020. Covid-19 victim.**

This is a program which simulates a virus exhibiting exponential growth. To add some subtleties, it also takes into account isolation and mingling factors amongst other things. You can specify the growth rate, isolation level, mingling factor etc. at runtime.

Doesn't rely upon any specific Java language features so should work with any version of Java.
