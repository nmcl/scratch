Some JTA related examples.

Note, things in this directory are rough and not intended for others to use. Really a workspace for hacking around some issues with GraalVM and/or the Narayana JTA implementation. Will eventually create a stable repository for end results.

JTA classes are downloaded from OTN and covered by the Oracle licence.

Contents of lib directory are built from the fork within graalvm.
