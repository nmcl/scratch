Some GraalVM work. Includes examples (some from the official Graal site) but also attempts to make Narayana transactions work.

Remember to do something like the following:

export GRAALVM_HOME=/usr/local/graalvm-ee-1.0.0-rc15/Contents/Home
export PATH=/usr/local/graalvm-ee-1.0.0-rc15/Contents/Home/bin:$PATH

No longer actively maintained. Moved to Quarkus effort (https://quarkus.io and https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus)
