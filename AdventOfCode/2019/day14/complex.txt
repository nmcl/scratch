2 VPVL, 7 FWMGM, 2 CXFTF, 4 MNCFX => 1 STKFG
2 NVRVD, 3 JNWZP => 8 VPVL
2 STKFG => 1 FUEL
2 VJHF, 2 MNCFX => 5 FWMGM
139 ORE => 4 NVRVD
144 ORE => 7 JNWZP
5 MNCFX, 7 RFSQX, 2 FWMGM, 2 VPVL, 19 CXFTF => 3 HVMC
5 VJHF, 7 MNCFX, 9 VPVL, 2 CXFTF => 6 GNMV
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX

1 FUEL needs 2 STKFG

----

2 STKFG: 2 times [2 VPVL, 7 FWMGM, 2 CXFTF, 4 MNCFX]

Synthesizing STKFG:
2 VPVL, 7 FWMGM, 2 CXFTF, 4 MNCFX => 1 STKFG

Synthesizing VPVL:
2 NVRVD, 3 JNWZP => 8 VPVL

Synthesizing NVRVD:
139 ORE => 4 NVRVD
We need 2 NVRVD, so consume 2 and store 2 [139 ORE, 2 NRVD in storage]

Synthesizing JNWZP:
144 ORE => 7 JNWZP
We need 3 JNWZP, so consume 3 and store 4 [283 ORE, 2 NRVD, 4 JNWZP in storage]

Synthesizing VPVL now possible:
8 VPVL from 2 NRVD and 3 JNWZP. We need 2 so store remaining 6. [283 ORE, 2 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL in storage]

----ONLY ONE LOOP OF 2 VPVL DONE SO FAR----

Synthesizing FWMGM:
2 VJHF, 2 MNCFX => 5 FWMGM

Synthesizing VJHF:
176 ORE => 6 VJHF
We need 2 VJHF, so consume 2 and store 4 [456 ORE, 2 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL, 4 VJHF in storage]

Synthesizing MNCFX:
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX
We need 2 MNCFX, so consume 2 and store 4 [604 ORE, 2 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL, 4 VJHF, 4 MNCFX in storage]

Synthesizing 7 FWMGM now possible using 2 of each we've created:
5 FWMGM from 2 VJHF and 2 MNCFX. We create 5 and store 5. [604 ORE, 2 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL, 4 VJHF, 4 MNCFX, 5 FWMGM in storage]
5 FWMGM from 2 VJHF and 2 MNCFX. Store remaining 3. [604 ORE, 2 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL, 2 VJHF, 2 MNCFX, 3 FWMGM in storage]

----ONLY ONE LOOP OF 7 FWMGM DONE SO FAR----

Synthesizing CXFTF:
1 NVRVD => 8 CXFTF
Found NRVD in storage. We need 2 CXFTF. Use NRVD and store excess CXFTF. [604 ORE, 1 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL, 2 VJHF, 2 MNCFX, 3 FWMGM, 6 CXFTF in storage]

----ONLY ONE LOOP OF 2 CXFTF DONE SO FAR----

LOOP 1:
2 NVRVD, 3 JNWZP => 8 VPVL
139 ORE => 4 NVRVD [139 ORE, 2 NVRVD in storage] 2 NVRVD
144 ORE => 7 JNWZP [283 ORE, 2 NVRVD and 4 JNWZP in storage] 2 NVRVD, 3 JNWZP => 8 VPVL but we only need 2 VPVL
We need 2 VPVL so [283 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP and 6 VPVL in storage]
**Leave 2 VPVL in storage for now! [283 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP and 8 VPVL in storage]

LOOP 2:
2 VPVL from storage. [283 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP and 4 VPVL in storage] 4 VPVL
**Leave other 2 (hence 4 total) VPVL in storage for now! [283 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP and 8 VPVL in storage]

LOOP 1:
2 VJHF, 2 MNCFX => 5 FWMGM
176 ORE => 6 VJHF but we only need 2 VJHF [459 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 MNCFX and 4 VJHF in storage]
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX but we only need 2 MNCFX [604 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 MNCFX and 4 VJHF in storage]
We have 5 FWMGM but we need 7 FWMGM. Get 2 FWMGM by using storage (2 VJHF, 2 MNCFX) => [604 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 2 MNCFX and 2 VJHF in storage] 7 FWMGM

LOOP 2:
Use storage for first 5 FWMGM (2 VJHF, 2 MNCFX). [604 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, and 4 VPVL in storage] 5 FWMGM
We have 5 FWMGM but we need 7 FWMGM.
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX but we only need 2 MNCFX [749 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL and 4 MNCFX in storage]
176 ORE => 6 VJHF but we only need 2 VJHF [925 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 MNCFX and 4 VJHF in storage]

LOOP 1:
1 NVRVD => 8 CXFTF
We have sufficient in storage => [925 ORE, 1 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 MNCFX, 4 VJHF and 6 CXFTF in storage] as we need 2 CXFTF

LOOP 2:
Sufficient in storage => [925 ORE, 1 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 MNCFX, 4 VJHF and 4 CXFTF in storage] 4 CXFTF

LOOP 1:
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX
Use storage for first 4 MNCFX. [925 ORE, 1 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 VJHF and 4 CXFTF in storage]
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX but we only need 4 MNCFX. [1070 ORE, 1 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 VJHF, 2 MNCFX and 4 CXFTF in storage]
