2 VPVL, 7 FWMGM, 2 CXFTF, 4 MNCFX => 1 STKFG
2 NVRVD, 3 JNWZP => 8 VPVL
2 STKFG, 6 MNCFX, 2 VJHF, 2 HVMC, 2 CXFTF, 2 GNMV => 1 FUEL
2 VJHF, 2 MNCFX => 5 FWMGM
139 ORE => 4 NVRVD
144 ORE => 7 JNWZP
5 MNCFX, 7 RFSQX, 2 FWMGM, 2 VPVL, 19 CXFTF => 3 HVMC
5 VJHF, 7 MNCFX, 9 VPVL, 2 CXFTF => 6 GNMV
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX
1 NVRVD => 8 CXFTF
1 VJHF, 6 MNCFX => 4 RFSQX
176 ORE => 6 VJHF

1 FUEL needs 2 STKFG, 6 MNCFX, 2 VJHF, 2 HVMC, 2 CXFTF and 2 GNMV 

----

2 STKFG: 2 times [2 VPVL, 7 FWMGM, 2 CXFTF, 4 MNCFX]

LOOP 1:
2 NVRVD, 3 JNWZP => 8 VPVL
139 ORE => 4 NVRVD [139 ORE, 2 NVRVD in storage] 2 NVRVD
144 ORE => 7 JNWZP [283 ORE, 2 NVRVD and 4 JNWZP in storage] 2 NVRVD, 3 JNWZP => 8 VPVL but we only need 2 VPVL
We need 2 VPVL so [283 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP and 6 VPVL in storage]

LOOP 2:
2 VPVL from storage. [283 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP and 4 VPVL in storage] 4 VPVL

LOOP 1:
2 VJHF, 2 MNCFX => 5 FWMGM
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX but we only need 2 MNCFX [428 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL and 4 MNCFX in storage]
176 ORE => 6 VJHF but we only need 2 VJHF [604 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 MNCFX and 4 VJHF in storage]
We have 5 FWMGM but we need 7 FWMGM. Get 2 FWMGM by using storage => [604 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 2 MNCFX and 2 VJHF in storage] 7 FWMGM

LOOP 2:
Use storage for first 5 FWMGM. [604 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, and 4 VPVL in storage] 5 FWMGM
We have 5 FWMGM but we need 7 FWMGM.
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX but we only need 2 MNCFX [749 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL and 4 MNCFX in storage]
176 ORE => 6 VJHF but we only need 2 VJHF [925 ORE, 2 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 MNCFX and 4 VJHF in storage]

LOOP 1:
1 NVRVD => 8 CXFTF
We have sufficient in storage => [925 ORE, 1 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 MNCFX, 4 VJHF and 6 CXFTF in storage] as we need 2 CXFTF

LOOP 2:
Sufficient in storage => [925 ORE, 1 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 MNCFX, 4 VJHF and 4 CXFTF in storage] 4 CXFTF

LOOP 1:
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX
Use storage for first 4 MNCFX. [925 ORE, 1 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 VJHF and 4 CXFTF in storage]
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX but we only need 4 MNCFX. [1070 ORE, 1 NVRVD, 4 JNWZP, 4 VPVL, 4 VJHF, 2 MNCFX and 4 CXFTF in storage]
