Currently [0 ORE, empty storage]

Synthesizing STKFG:
2 VPVL, 7 FWMGM, 2 CXFTF, 4 MNCFX => 1 STKFG

Synthesizing VPVL:
2 NVRVD, 3 JNWZP => 8 VPVL

Synthesizing NVRVD:
139 ORE => 4 NVRVD
We need 2 NVRVD, so consume 2 and store 2 [139 ORE, 2 NRVD in storage]

Synthesizing JNWZP:
144 ORE => 7 JNWZP
We need 3 JNWZP, so consume 3 and store 4 [283 ORE, 2 NRVD, 4 JNWZP in storage]

Synthesizing VPVL now possible:
8 VPVL from 2 NRVD and 3 JNWZP. We need 2 so store remaining 6. [283 ORE, 2 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL in storage]

----ONLY ONE LOOP OF 2 VPVL DONE SO FAR----

Synthesizing FWMGM:
2 VJHF, 2 MNCFX => 5 FWMGM

Synthesizing VJHF:
176 ORE => 6 VJHF
We need 2 VJHF, so consume 2 and store 4 [456 ORE, 2 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL, 4 VJHF in storage]

Synthesizing MNCFX:
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX
We need 2 MNCFX, so consume 2 and store 4 [604 ORE, 2 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL, 4 VJHF, 4 MNCFX in storage]

Synthesizing 7 FWMGM now possible using 2 of each we've created:
5 FWMGM from 2 VJHF and 2 MNCFX. We create 5 and store 5. [604 ORE, 2 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL, 4 VJHF, 4 MNCFX, 5 FWMGM in storage]
5 FWMGM from 2 VJHF and 2 MNCFX. Store remaining 3. [604 ORE, 2 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL, 2 VJHF, 2 MNCFX, 3 FWMGM in storage]

----ONLY ONE LOOP OF 7 FWMGM DONE SO FAR----

Synthesizing CXFTF:
1 NVRVD => 8 CXFTF
Found NRVD in storage. We need 2 CXFTF. Use NRVD and store excess CXFTF. [604 ORE, 1 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL, 2 VJHF, 2 MNCFX, 3 FWMGM, 6 CXFTF in storage]

----ONLY ONE LOOP OF 2 CXFTF DONE SO FAR----

Synthesizing MNCFX:
145 ORE => 6 MNCFX
We need 4 MNCFX so store excess. [749 ORE, 1 NRVD, 4 JNWZP, 6 VPVL, 2 VJHF, 4 MNCFX, 3 FWMGM, 6 CXFTF in storage]

----ONLY ONE LOOP OF 4 MNCFX DONE SO FAR----
