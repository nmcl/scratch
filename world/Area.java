/**
 * An Area represents a 2x2 square. Within that region things happen such as:
 * - creatures grow
 * - CO2 levels change (affects life)
 * - temperature levels change (affects life)
 * - water flows (affects life); can be rivers, rain, ocean etc.
 * - 
 *
 * Eventually these should be replaced with Volumes (or a Volume is made up of Areas).
