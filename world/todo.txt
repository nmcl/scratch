Need some way or defining the probability that a "gene" will evolve.

Need some way to define key "gene" values that help the current generation survive better than others and hence should not be evolved away. Beneficial versus harmful.

Each attribute of DNA should have some kind of "Goldilocks zone" whereby values within a certain range are stable, those below a value are detrimental and those above are beneficial.

- DNA strand class per trait.
- Each trait encodes the rules.
- Also the probability of mutation based on the current value.

The animal class contains values for each trait. We then give the current value to the Trait instance for each value and ask it to generate a new number. The new number is then used to influence whether the creature will live or die.
