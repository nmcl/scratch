Need some way or defining the probability that a "gene" will evolve.

Need some way to define key "gene" values that help the current generation survive better than others and hence should not be evolved away. Beneficial versus harmful.

Each attribute of DNA should have some kind of "Goldilocks zone" whereby values within a certain range are stable, those below a value are detrimental and those above are beneficial.
