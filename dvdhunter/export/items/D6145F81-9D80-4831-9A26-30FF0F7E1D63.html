</strong>Too old for Hamlet and too young for Lear--what's an ambitious actor to do? Play the Devil, of course. Jack Nicholson did it in <i>The Witches of Eastwick</i>; Robert De Niro did it in <i>Angel Heart</i> (as Louis Cyphre--get it?). In <i>The Devil's Advocate</i> Al Pacino takes his turn as the great Satan, and clearly relishes his chance to raise hell. He's a New York lawyer, of course, by the name of John Milton, who recruits a hotshot young Florida attorney (Keanu Reeves) to his firm and seduces him with tempting offers of power, sex and money. Think of the story as a twist on John Grisham's <i>The Firm</i>, with the corporate evil made even more explicit. Reeves is wooden, and therefore doesn't seem to have much of a soul to lose, but he's really just our excuse to meet the devil. Pacino's the main attraction, gleefully showing off his--and the Antichrist's--chops at perpetrating menace and mayhem. <i>--Jim Emerson</i></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; German; Italian; Spanish</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>1998-11-20</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-04</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2015-01-01 12:32 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
