</strong>The pressure was really on <I>The Sarah Connor Chronicles</I> right from the start. The first spin-off from the extraordinary <I>Terminator</I> franchise, it picks up after the events of the second film, and finds Lena Headey in the title role, who--along with her 15-year old son, John--sets about trying to save the world from the impending threat of Skynet. Along the way too, they encounter Summer Glau (whom there’s a strong chance you’ll know from <I>Firefly</I>), who steps into the shoes of Cameron, a bodyguard Terminator who helps fight off the many threats they face. She’s some piece of work. <p>Very deliberately paced, and intricately woven to make sure it safely fits within the <I>Terminator</I> universe, <I>The Sarah Connor Chronicles</I> works a great deal better than you’d have any right to expect. Tightly scripted, and with a terrific performance by Headey in the central role, the show packs plenty of action and narrative into the nine episodes of its maiden season, and it certainly whets the appetite for more. <p>Perhaps the biggest compliment to be paid, though, is that <I>The Sarah Connor Chronicles</I> is a worthy companion and follow-up to the first two <I>Terminator</I> films, and one that genuinely expands and deepens the franchise. It’ll be fascinating to see where the show goes next. --<I>Jon Foster</I></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>English; French; Spanish</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2008-08-19</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2015-01-02</p><p class="itemField"><strong>UPC: </strong>883929025176</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>3</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>16:9 - 1.78:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2015-01-02 15:11 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
