</strong>What's interesting about this video is also what makes it seem amateurish at first: it is neither endorsed nor authorised by 20th Century Fox or Lucasfilm. The result: a montage of interviews with everybody of importance to the Star Wars world--from George Lucas and Liam Neeson to Samuel L. Jackson and Harrison Ford, with intelligently written voice-over narration, and a unique exploration of Star Wars and Star Trek together. This is at once an homage to the <I>Star Wars</I> trilogies and a documentary of its sci-fi precursors, from silent film to <I>Star Trek</I>.<p>Since this collection of interviews isn't authorised by Lucasfilm, you won't find footage of the <I>Star Wars</I> movies here, although you will find terrific snippets from sci-fi milestones such as Fritz Lang's <I>Metropolis</I>. A youthful Carrie Fisher talk about the interplanetary appeal of the original <I>Star Wars</I>, while a 20-years-older Fischer talks about the films' fairytale-like grasp across generations. Young and older Harrison Fords and Mark Hamill give interesting perspectives as well; the video also sports one of the longer interviews recorded with the man inside C-3PO.<p>Besides the actual cast and crew of the <I>Star Wars</I> movies, including <I>The Phantom Menace</I>, there are interviews here with stars as fans, famous people who love the movies as much as anyone: Sharon Stone, Gary Busey, Hugh Hefner, Magic Johnson, Christina Ricci and William Shatner. A fun and provocative look through uncensored interviews across the spectrum at all that is <I>Star Wars</I>, worthy of any fan's archive, this is a must for any serious collection. --<I>Erik Macki</I></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>1995-10-16</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2015-12-16</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2015-12-16 22:45 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
