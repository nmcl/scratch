</strong>Sergio Leone had to be persuaded to return to the Western for <I>Once Upon a Time in the West</I> after the success of his "Dollars" trilogy. The result is a masterpiece that expands the vision of the earlier movies in every way. It could as easily have been called <I>The Good, the Bad, the Ugly and the Blonde</I> as Charles Bronson steps into the No-Name role as the harmonica-playing vengeance seeker, Henry Fonda trashes his Wyatt Earp image as a dead-faced, blue-eyed killer who has sold out to the rapacious railroad; Jason Robards provides humanitarian footnotes as a life-loving but doomed bandit and the astonishingly beautiful Claudia Cardinale shows that all these grown-up little boys are less fit to make a country than one determined widow-mother-whore-angel-everywoman. The opening sequence--Woody Strode, Al Mulock and Jack Elam waiting for a train and bothered by a fly and dripping water--is masterful bravura, homing in on tiny details for a fascinating but eventless length of time before Bronson arrives for the lightning-fast shoot-out. With striking widescreen compositions and epic running time, this picture truly wins points for length and width. <p><B>On the DVD:</B> <I>Once Upon a Time in the West</I> on disc is the transfer fans have been waiting for: the longest available version of the film in shimmering widescreen (enhanced for 16:9 TVs) which lends full impact to Leone's long shots of Monument Valley scenery or bustling crowds of activity, but also highlights his ultra-close images as Bronson's beady eyes or Cardinale's luscious pout fill the entire screen. A commentary track is mostly by expert Sir Christopher Frayling, with input from other academics, participants and enthusiasts--it's good on the detail, and Alex Cox winningly points out that one scene bizarrely can't be reconciled with what happens before or after it. <p>Disc 2 has four featurettes which, taken together, add up to a feature-length documentary on the film, and though overlapping the commentary slightly offer a wealth of further good stuff, plus the elegant Cardinale's undiminished smile. Also included is the trailer, notes on the cast, menu screens with generous selections from Ennio Morricone's score, stills gallery, comparison shots from the film and contemporary snapshots of the locations. --<I>Kim Newman</I></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>Arabic; Bulgarian; Croatian; Czech; Danish; Dutch; Finnish; French; German; Greek; Hebrew; Icelandic; Norwegian; Polish; Portuguese; Romanian; Serbian; Slovene; Spanish; Swedish; Turkish; English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2003-10-06</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-01 19:01 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
