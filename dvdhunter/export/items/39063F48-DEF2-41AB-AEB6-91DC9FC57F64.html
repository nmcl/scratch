</strong>One explanation for the enduring appeal of George Lucas' "space opera" might be that the <I>Star Wars</I> universe is a clever synthesis of a multitude of filmic, cultural and folkloric references, from Robin Hood (the Errol Flynn incarnation of course) to Tolkien to Samurai legends and Kurosawa's <I>Hidden Fortress</I> in particular (the inspiration for R2D2 and C3PO). As a result, audiences of almost all ages can find something to identify with. Luke Skywalker's journey from disaffected teenager dreaming of adventure beyond the narrow confines of home life to Jedi Knight and saviour of the galaxy is the very stuff of fairy-tale: he not only rescues a Princess, but discovers she's a close relative (one explanation for the relatively cool reception accorded to <I>The Phantom Menace</I> might be that it sacrifices the fairy-tale theme for political machination). If there's a lesson to be gleaned from the Skywalker clan it's that no matter how bad things get in the average dysfunctional family, it's never too late for reconciliation. Little wonder, then, that <I>Star Wars</I> continues to grip our collective imagination.<p> This box contains, among other delights, the digitally remastered "Special Edtion" versions of the movies, restored and enhanced (some would say "tinkered with") by George Lucas in 1997. <I>Star Wars</I> has the most drastic changes, the best of which are the improved effects sequences; the worst the Cantina showdown where Han Solo near-suicidally now allows Greedo to get off a shot before firing back (since he misses at point-blank range, Greedo must be a very poor assassin indeed). The restoration of the Jabba-Solo scene is interesting although the CGI isn't completely convincing. <I>The Empire Strikes Back</I> also has touched-up effects shots, most spectacularly the expanded vistas of Cloud City; <I>Return of the Jedi</I> has a new song-and-dance number in Jabba's Palace (which is just as excruciating as the original) and a revised ending that looks forward (or should that be backwards?) to Episode I. Also included here is a 10-minute sneak preview of Episode II, due for theatrical release in Summer 2002, featuring interviews with Lucas and other cast and crew members. --<I>Mark Walker</I></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2000-11-20</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2015-12-16</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>3</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2015-12-16 22:44 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
