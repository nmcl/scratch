</strong>Released amidst rumors of romance between costars Angelina Jolie and soon-to-be-divorced Brad Pitt, <i>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</i> offers automatic weapons and high explosives as the cure for marital boredom. The premise of this exhausting action-comedy (no relation to the 1941 Alfred Hitchcock comedy starring Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery) is that the unhappily married Smiths (Pitt and Jolie) will improve their relationship once they discover their mutually-hidden identities as world-class assassins, but things get complicated when their secret-agency bosses order them to rub each other out. There's plenty of amusing banter in the otherwise disposable screenplay by Simon Kinberg, and director Doug Liman gives Pitt and Jolie a slick, glossy superstar showcase that's innocuous but certainly never boring. It could've been better, but as an action-packed summer confection, <i>Mr. and Mrs. Smith</i> kills two hours in high style. <i>--Jeff Shannon, Amazon.com</i></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; English; Spanish</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>Spanish; Dutch; English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2007-12-24</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-04</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>16:9 - 2.35:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-04 22:39 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
