</strong>Jake Gyllenhaal's doe eyes and bulging biceps will make some hearts flutter in <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em>. Dastan (Gyllenhaal), adopted prince of the Persian empire, must flee into the desert when accused of murdering his royal father--but a glass-handled dagger he found as loot from a captured city turns out to hold powerful time-manipulating magic. Not only is he pursued by his vengeful brothers, his scheming uncle (Ben Kingsley, <em>Sexy Beast</em>), and a strange cabal of assassins, but a princess/priestess named Tamina (Gemma Arterton, <em>Quantum of Solace</em>) wants the dagger back and will kill Dastan if she has to. <em>Prince of Persia</em> wants to be a rollicking adventure along the lines of <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>. Unfortunately, it's hampered by clumsy dialogue and hard-to-follow action sequences, with choppy editing that wrecks the flow of the parkour-inspired stunts. But the production design is extravagant and every time Alfred Molina (<em>Spiderman 2</em>) appears as a greedy sheik the movie gets a delightful jolt of energy. Gyllenhaal doesn't have much to work with--Dastan is a fairly generic hero--and whoever designed his hair should have been fired on the first day, but his lazy charm comes through and carries him through the movie. <em>--Bret Fetzer</em></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2010-09-13</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2015-05-29</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2015-05-29 19:21 +0100</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
