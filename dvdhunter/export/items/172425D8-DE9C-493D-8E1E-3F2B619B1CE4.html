</strong>This smart, tautly directed thriller from Wolfgang Petersen is about the cat-and-mouse games between a Secret Service agent named Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and the brilliant, psychopathic assassin (John Malkovich) who's itching to get the President in his cross hairs. <I>In the Line of Fire</I>'s back-story--Horrigan is haunted by his inability to prevent John Kennedy's assassination (Eastwood is computer-generated into archival footage)--is more than a little hokey, but the plotting itself is smartly, even ingeniously, constructed. Petersen manages a vice-like grip on the tension and Eastwood even gets to deliver an ever-more-timely lecture on the diminished nature of the office of President. Eastwood's as gruff and as infuriating to the by-the-book Powers That Be as ever and Malkovich oozes delightful menace. Rene Russo capably co-stars as a colleague with whom Horrigan gets friendly. <I>--David Kronke</I></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; English; Russian; Spanish</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>Arabic; Bulgarian; Croatian; Czech; Danish; English; Finnish; Hebrew; Hindi; Hungarian; Icelandic; Greek; Norwegian; Polish; Portuguese; Romanian; Slovene; Spanish; Swedish; Turkish</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2008-06-23</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-10-04</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>16:9 - 2.40:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-10-04 19:12 +0100</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
