</strong>A psychopath nicknamed Buffalo Bill is murdering women across the Midwest. Believing it takes one to know one, the FBI sends Agent Clarice Starling (Foster) to interview a demented prisoner who may provide clues to the killer's actions. That prisoner is psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins), a brilliant, diabolical cannibal who agrees to help Starling only if she'll feed his morbid curiosity with details of her own complicated life. As their relationship develops, Starling is forced to confront not only her own hidden demons, but also an evil so powerful that she may not have the courage or strength to stop it!</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2010-09-14</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>UPC: </strong>883904220626</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>2.35:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-01 21:38 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
