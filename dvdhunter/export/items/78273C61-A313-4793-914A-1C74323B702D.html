</strong>He's back. A hero for our millennium. And not a moment too soon, because during the five years (much longer in movie-fan years!) Superman sought his home planet, things changed on his adopted planet. Nations moved on without him. Lois Lane now has a son, a fiance and a Pulitzer for "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman." And Lex Luthor has a plan that will destroy millions - no, billions - of lives. Filmmaker Bryan Singer (X-Men) gives the world the Superman it needs, honoring the legend everyone loves while taking it in a powerful new direction. Brandon Routh proves a perfect choice to wear the hero's cape, leading a top cast that includes Kate Bosworth as Lois and Kevin Spacey as Lex. And the thrills - from a sky-grapple with a tumbling jumbo jet to a continent-convulsing showdown - redefine Wow. "I'm always around," Superman tells Lois. You'll be glad he is.</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; French; German; Spanish</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>English; Spanish; French</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2006-11-28</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>UPC: </strong>012569823372</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>2.40:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-01 19:18 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
