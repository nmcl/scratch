</strong><a name="review">You don’t have to be familiar with Formula One--or the tragic destiny of Ayrton Senna--to enjoy this visceral encounter with one of racing’s finest talents. Spanning a decade of Formula One from 1984, <em>Senna</em> picks through archive footage to show a world where traditional driving skills are under threat from the unsporting forces of big business and technical engineering. A gifted newcomer, Senna goes from anonymity at the back of a rain-soaked debut at Monaco to three-time world champion--earning him legendary status in Brazil and igniting the hopes of a struggling population along the way. Between races director Asif Kapadia (<em>The Warrior, Far North</em>) shows us an isolated figure: unskilled at the politics of Formula One and speaking to journalists about ‘pure driving' as a metaphor for life. On the track, his fierce will to win--fuelled by a bitter rivalry with team-mate Alain Prost--pushes him to the limits of racing brinkmanship, and the scenes of Senna dueling in the wet, weaving down the straight or accelerating towards the disappearing space of a corner rank among the greatest moments of any sports documentary. <em>--Leo Batchelor</em></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; English; English; None; Portuguese; Japanese</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2011-11-08</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-06-02</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>16:9 - 1.85:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-06-02 20:25 +0100</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
