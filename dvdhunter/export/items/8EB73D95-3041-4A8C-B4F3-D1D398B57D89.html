</strong>The title character of <I>Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo</I>, played by <I>Saturday Night Live</I> alumnus and Adam Sandler sidekick Rob Schneider, is a miserable fish-tank cleaner who stumbles onto a new and different lifestyle when he looks after the fish of a high-priced male prostitute (Oded Fehr from <I>The Mummy</I>). Deuce teams up with a man-pimp (Eddie Griffin), gets harassed by a crazed cop (William Forsythe), and of course falls in love with a cute client (Arija Bareikis). The nonsensical plot is festooned with gags about wet T-shirts, foul-mouthed senior citizens, flatulence, Tourette's syndrome, narcolepsy, and just about everything else you might imagine. More surprising is that, by and large, the movie works. It's a combination of bad taste and goodheartedness, similar to <I>There's Something About Mary</I>, which <I>Deuce Bigalow</I> is clearly emulating. It's not the pat "people should learn to accept themselves for who they are" theme or the formulaic happy ending; it's that the movie understands that sex is not the same thing as happiness or contentment. For all its crassness, <I>Deuce Bigalow</I> actually treats its characters as people, and the result is silly, obnoxious, and enjoyable. --<I>Bret Fetzer, Amazon.com</I></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>English; Swedish; Finnish; Danish; Icelandic</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2001-03-05</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>UPC: </strong>501718888152</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>16:9 - 1.85:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-01 19:11 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
