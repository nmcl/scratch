</strong>Oscar winner Adrien Brody (The Pianist, Predators) stars as a man who wakes up trapped in a crashed car in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by two dead passengers, a pile of cash and a gun. He has no recollection of who he is or how he got there. Is he an innocent victim? A dangerous criminal? All he knows is he s fighting for his life and his sanity in the middle of the deep woods. Like a cross between Deliverance and The Bourne Identity, director Michael Greenspan s feature debut showcases another acclaimed turn by one of the most lauded and talented actors of our time.</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2011-08-30</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-03</p><p class="itemField"><strong>UPC: </strong>030306187792</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>2.35:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-03 20:22 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
