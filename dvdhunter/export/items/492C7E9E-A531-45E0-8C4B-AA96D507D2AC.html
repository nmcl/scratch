</strong>A gloriously over-the-top treat, Paul Verhoeven's <i>Starship Troopers</i> takes the militaristic moralising of Robert Heinlein's pulp classic and sets about undermining it mercilessly. Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) desperately wants to join the Mobile Infantry and kill some Earth-threatening alien bugs. He also desperately wants Carmen (Denise Richards), but only gets to fulfil one ambition in the second of Verhoeven's futuristic satires (also cowritten with his <i>RoboCop</i> scriptwriter Ed Neumeier). <p>Set in a fascist future where kids must do military service to qualify as citizens, own property or even have babies, the film's dark Vietnam and Nazi-era parallels are all the more disturbing given its deceptively sunny <i>Beverly Hills 90210</i> teenage cast (though scenery-chewing veteran Michael Ironside steals the movie as tough-talking Lt Rasczak). The CGI arachnids are among the most convincing and dangerous-looking creatures ever seen on screen, and with the movie clocking up the highest number of blanks ever fired on a film set, it's also pretty loud. Verhoeven went on to be Executive Producer of the <i>Roughnecks: The Starship Troopers Chronicles</i> animated TV series a couple of years later. --<i>Paul Tonks</i></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; English; English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>English; Spanish; Swedish; Norwegian; Danish; Finnish; Icelandic; Dutch; French</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2007-08-06</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-04-10</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>16:9 - 1.85:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-04-10 18:02 +0100</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
