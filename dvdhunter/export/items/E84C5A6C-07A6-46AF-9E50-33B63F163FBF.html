</strong>Box set containing all four films from the popular Lethal Weapon series. In Lethal Weapon 1987, Roger Murtaugh Danny Glover is a family man cop who is about to turn fifty. Cautious by nature, he is less than happy to be paired with Martin Riggs Mel Gibson when he is assigned to investigate Californian drug baron The General Mitchell Ryan. Following the death of his wife, Riggs has become a manic loner who no longer cares whether he lives or dies - an approach which causes more than a few problems as he and Murtaugh attempt to bring the General to justice. In Lethal Weapon 2 1989, Riggs Gibson and his partner Murtaugh Glover once again tackle the evils of drug smuggling, this time coming up against a South African syndicate whose kingpins are protected by diplomatic immunity. In Lethal Weapon 3 1992, Detectives Murtaugh Glover and Riggs Gibson are both demoted after triggering a car bomb in a multi-storey car park, but they are soon reinstated after uncovering a network - run by an ex-cop - which is smuggling weapons out of a police ammunition dump. Finally, in Lethal Weapon 4 1998, mismatched cops Riggs Gibson and Murtaugh Glover team up for a fourth time to foil an immigrant smuggling racket, run by a ruthless Asian Triad leader Jet Li. Joe Pesci also returns as Leo Getz, the cops cowardly informant whilst Rene Russo leavens the boys with toys atmosphere as risk-taking detective Lorna Cole.</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>UPC: </strong>700220338654</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>0</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-01 21:23 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
