</strong>Oscarr Winner Matt Damon gives a heartfelt performance in this "delightful surprise" (Lou Lumenick, New York Post) that's based on a true story. When his teenage son gets into trouble, Benjamin Mee (Damon) gives up a lucrative newspaper job to move his family to the most unlikely of places: a zoo! With help from an eclectic staff, and with many misadventures along the way, Benjamin embarks on a fresh beginning to restore the dilapidated zoo to its former glory, while uniting his family. From the director of Jerry Maguire, We Bought a Zoo is a "wonderful, warm and witty" (Bill Bregoli, CBS Radio News) celebration of the human spirit.</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; English; English; French; Spanish</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>English; Spanish</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2012-04-03</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>UPC: </strong>024543751694</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>1.85:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-01 20:52 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
