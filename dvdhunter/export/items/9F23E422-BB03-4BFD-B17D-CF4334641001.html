</strong><I>Total Recall</I>, director Paul Verhoeven's mega-budget sci-fi action blockbuster from 1990, began its production life as a very different movie. An adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story "We Can Remember It for You Wholesale", it was originally conceived of with Richard Dreyfuss starring as a Walter-Mitty-like character who experiences a variety of artificially induced fantasies. But with Arnold Schwarzenegger on board, the final version took a rather different direction. The Austrian Oak plays a normal working man who discovers his entire reality has been invented to conceal a scheme for planetary domination on Mars. Oscar-winning special effects and violent action propel the twisting plot, in which Arnold manipulates his manipulators in a world of dazzling high technology. Verhoeven (<I>Robocop</I>, <I>Starship Troopers</I>) indulges his usual penchant for gratuitous bloodshed, but the movie has enough cleverness to rise above its excesses. --<I>Jeff Shannon, Amazon.com</I><p> <B>On the DVD</B>: Not many extras, but excellent picture and sound. The reds of Mars are a terrific way of testing your television's colour definition in this digital transfer. Combine that with testing your speakers in the opening scene to Jerry Goldsmith's pounding score boosted to Dolby 5.1, and what an ideal home cinema demo disc this is! Two trailers show the way a film should and shouldn't be advertised, since the teaser gives nothing away but the main advert tells you everything. A seven-minute behind the scenes featurette with cast interviews and on-set action rounds out the extras package. --<I>Paul Tonks</I></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; French; German; English; French; German</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>French; German; English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2012-07-16</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-04-10</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>16:9 - 1.85:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-04-10 18:02 +0100</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
