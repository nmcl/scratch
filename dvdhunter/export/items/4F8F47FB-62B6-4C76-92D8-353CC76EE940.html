</strong>Thanks to repeated showings on cable television and home video, this speculative thriller has built quite a loyal following since its release in 1978. The provocative "what if?" scenario still packs a punch, even if it is not always believable. James Brolin, Sam Waterston and O J Simpson star as three astronauts who agree to spare the government embarrassment by faking their historic landing on Mars after their spacecraft is determined to be unsafe for blastoff. When a scheming mission controller (Hal Holbrook) plots to kill the astronauts in a staged capsule fire, the trio embarks on a dangerous mission to expose the truth. Elliott Gould costars as the journalist determined to crack the conspiracy, and director Peter Hyams turns up the tension with an exciting chase sequence involving Telly Savalas as an eccentric barnstormer who comes to Gould's aid in his attempt rescue the hoax mission's sole survivor. <i>--Jeff Shannon</i></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2014-08-04</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2015-01-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2015-01-01 12:28 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
