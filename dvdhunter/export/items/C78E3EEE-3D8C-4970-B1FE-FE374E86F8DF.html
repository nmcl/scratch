</strong>"This man will be our hero, for fate will make him indestructible." Earth is under attack by the ultra-powerful Mysterons and one man holds the key to survival--Captain Scarlet! During a mission to Mars in 2068, agents of earth's Spectrum security force start an interplanetary war when they demolish the ancient city of the Mysterons, an invisible race with the ability to assume the form of any object or person they destroy. But their attempt to take over Spectrum's top agent--Captain Scarlet--fails, and he becomes their most powerful and implacable enemy.<P> With stunning special effects, a new generation of realistic "Super-marionation" puppets, and a darker, more serious tone than its predecessors, CAPTAIN SCARLET AND THE MYSTERONS was producer Gerry Anderson's (<I>Space: 1999</I>, <I>Stingray</I>, <I>UFO</I>, <I>Thunderbirds</I>) most ambitious series. This exclusive DVD set includes all 32 episodes, available uncut and digitally remastered for the first time.</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2002-06-25</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>UPC: </strong>733961704709</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>4</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>1.33:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-01 20:56 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
