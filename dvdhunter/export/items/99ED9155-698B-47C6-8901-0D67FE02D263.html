</strong>Steven Spielberg's alien abduction opus <I>Taken</I> is what happens when you cross-breed <I>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</I> with <I>The Waltons</I>. Obviously flushed with the success of the TV mini-series <I>Band of Brothers</I>, Spielberg's Dreamworks studio has created an equally epic 10-part story chronicling 50 years of habitual abduction over several generations of three American families. <p> Beginning with the most notorious alien cover-up in US history, the 1947 "crash" at Roswell, New Mexico, <I>Taken</I> introduces the "Greys" and the families they routinely abduct, probe and, in a couple of cases, impregnate over the course of the ten hour-and-a-half-long episodes. The three families are: the Keys, from which first Russell, then his son Jessie, then grandson Danny, are all abducted; the Clarkes, who are descended from a liaison between lonely put-upon housewife Sally Clarke and one of the Roswell crash survivors; and the Crawfords, the ruthless G-men who are committed to uncovering the purpose behind the alien visitations at any cost. <p> But even though the Greys' actions are at best ambiguous and at worst hostile, <I>Taken</I> is basically a soap opera, lacking the sinister undercurrent of either <I>Dark Skies</I> or <I>The X-Files</I> despite its science-fiction trappings. Nevertheless, this is an engaging series which has decent performances--most notably Joel Gretsch as psychotic Owen Crawford--special effects and an engaging enough storyline to make it entertaining, if somewhat disposable, TV. --<I>Kristen Bowditch</I></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2010-10-04</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2015-01-02</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>6</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2015-01-02 15:16 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
