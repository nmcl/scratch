</strong>There was an understandable mix of emotions bubbling to the surface when the final episode of <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> was finally broadcast in the first half of 2009. On the one hand, this has proven to be vintage science fiction television, easily one of the most ambitious, daring and flat-out successful TV projects in recent times. And on the other, it’s all over, with this box set bringing together the final episodes of the show. <p> Inevitably, this final season wraps up many of the mysteries and narrative questions of <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>, none of which we intend to spoil here. The fate of humanity, the hunt for the fabled earth and the further revelations about the Cylons are packed in, and the standard throughout this final season remains sky high. <p> The actual ending itself, as it happens, proved quite divisive, but arguably that’s part of the strength of <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>. Because this is a show that, right to the end, doesn’t take the easy road, and delivers some of the most intelligent, dark drama of recent years. It’s a staggering achievement, and this final season, along with the entirety of the show itself, is set to still be talked about decades into the future. Quite brilliant, and not to be missed. --<I>Jon Foster</I></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; None; None</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2009-06-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>4</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>16:9 - 1.78:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-01 19:09 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
