</strong>Ian McKellen stars as the famous sleuth Sherlock Holmes in this crime drama adaptation directed by Bill Condon. Set in 1947, the long-retired detective, now aged 93, lives in exile and spends his days tending to his bees and completing his memoirs. As Holmes examines the numerous achievements of his life, he finds himself continually troubled by his last ever case involving a beautiful woman (Hattie Morahan) which still remains unsolved. With his health failing, and his mind not as sharp as it once was, Holmes uses his fragmented memories of the case to try and piece the mystery together.</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2015-10-26</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2016-01-31</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2016-01-31 12:24 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
