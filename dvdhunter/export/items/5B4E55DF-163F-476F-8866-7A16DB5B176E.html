</strong>A stupendous historical saga, <I>Braveheart</I> won five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for star Mel Gibson. He plays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish commoner who unites the various clans against a cruel English King, Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan). The scenes of hand-to-hand combat are brutally violent, but they never glorify the bloodshed. There is such enormous scope to this story that it works on a smaller, more personal scale as well, essaying love and loss, patriotism and passion. Extremely moving, it reveals Gibson as a multitalented performer and remarkable director with an eye for detail and an understanding of human emotion. (His first directorial effort was 1993's <I>Man Without a Face</I>.) The film is nearly three hours long and includes several plot tangents, yet is never dull. This movie resonates long after you have seen it, both for its visual beauty and for its powerful story. <I>--Rochelle O'Gorman</I></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2007-04-23</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2015-01-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2015-01-01 12:31 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
