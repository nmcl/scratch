</strong>There were only two ways for "classic Trek" cast members to appear in a movie with the cast of <I>Star Trek: The Next Generation</I>: either Captain Kirk and his contemporaries would have to be very, very old, or there would be some time travel involved in the plot. Since geriatric heroes aren't very exciting (despite a welcomed cameo appearance by the aged Dr McCoy), <I>Star Trek: Generations</I> unites Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) in a time-jumping race to stop a madman's quest for heavenly contentment. When a mysterious energy coil called the Nexus nearly destroys the newly christened USS Enterprise-B, the just-retired Kirk is lost and presumed dead. But he's actually been happily trapped in the timeless purgatory of the Nexus--an idyllic state of being described by the mystical Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) as "pure joy". Picard must convince Kirk to leave this artificial comfort zone and confront Dr Soran (Malcolm McDowell), the madman who will threaten billions of lives to be reunited with the addictive pleasure of the Nexus. With subplots involving the android Data's unpredictable "emotion chip" and the spectacular crash-landing of the starship Enterprise, this crossover movie not only satisfied <I>Trek</I> fans, but it also gave them something they'd never had to confront before: the heroic and truly final death of a beloved <I>Star Trek</I> character. Passing the torch to the <I>Next Generation</I> with dignity and entertaining adventure, the movie isn't going to please everyone with its somewhat hokey plot, but it still ranks as a worthy big-screen launch for Picard and his stalwart crew. --<I>Jeff Shannon, Amazon.com</I></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>German; English; German</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>1999-10-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-04</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-04 21:29 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
