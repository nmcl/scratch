</strong>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first in Peter Jackson's highly anticipated trilogy adapting the enduringly popular masterpiece The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien. <br/><br/>The adventure follows the journey of title character Bilbo Baggins, who is swept into an epic quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome Dragon Smaug. Approached out of the blue by the Wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of 13 Dwarves led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into the Wild, through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins, Orcs and deadly Wargs, as well as a mysterious and sinister figure known only as the Necromancer. <br/><br/>Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain, first they must escape the Goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever...Gollum. <br/><br/>Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of ingenuity and courage that surprise even him; he also gains possession of Gollum's "precious" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities...A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know. <br/><br/>Language: English <br/>Subtitles: English, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish <br/>Dubbed: French, German, Italian <br/>Subtitles For The Hearing Impaired: English, German, Italian</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>English</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-11-13</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>5</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-11-13 17:48 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
