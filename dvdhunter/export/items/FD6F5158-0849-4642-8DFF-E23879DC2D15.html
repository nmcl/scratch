</strong>In a time when it seems that every other movie makes some claim to being a <I>film noir</I>, <I>L.A. Confidential</I> is the real thing: a gritty, sordid tale of sex, scandal, betrayal and corruption of all sorts in 1940s Hollywood. The Oscar-winning screenplay is actually based on several titles in James Ellroy's series of chronological thriller novels (including the title volume, <I>The Big Nowhere</I>, and <I>White Jazz</I>)--a compelling blend of LA history and pulp fiction that has earned it comparisons to the greatest of all Technicolor <I>noir</I> films, <I>Chinatown</I>. Kim Basinger richly deserved her Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of a conflicted femme fatale; unfortunately, her male co-stars are so uniformly fine that they may have cancelled each other out with the Academy voters: Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey and James Cromwell play LAPD officers of varying stripes. Pearce's character is a particularly intriguing study in Hollywood amorality and ambition, a strait-laced "hero"; (and son of a departmental legend) whose career goals outweigh all other moral, ethical, and legal considerations. If he's a good guy, it's only because he sees it as the quickest route to a promotion. <I>--Jim Emerson</I></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>German</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-04</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2015-01-01 12:30 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
