</strong>This deluxe Blu-ray box set contains the Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy combo pack of <i>Inception</i> plus the shooting script of <i>Inception</i>. <p>Acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan directs an international cast in this sci-fi actioner that travels around the globe and into the world of dreams. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the best there is at extraction: stealing valuable secrets inside the subconscious during the mind's vulnerable dream state. His skill has made him a coveted player in industrial espionage but also has made him a fugitive and cost him dearly. Now he may get a second chance if he can do the impossible: inception, planting an idea rather than stealing one. If they succeed, Cobb and his team could pull off the perfect crime. But no planning or expertise can prepare them for a dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy only Cobb could have seen coming.</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; French</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>English; French; Spanish</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-02</p><p class="itemField"><strong>UPC: </strong>883929174300</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>3</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-02 08:22 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
