</strong>Hot Fuzz' helmsman Edgar Wright takes the reins on this epic adaptation of the cult comic book about a loveable loser who must prove his love by battling his girlfriend's seven evil exes. Fast-paced and frenetic fun for the videogame generation, this pop-culture spectacular really is the Bob-omb! Meet charming and jobless Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera). A bass guitarist for totally average garage band Sex Bob-omb, the 22-year-old has just met the girl of his dreams... literally. The only catch to winning Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead)? Her seven evil exes are coming to kill him. Genre-smashing filmmaker Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) tells the amazing story of one romantic slacker's quest to power up with love in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>UPC: </strong>700220334694</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>0</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-01 21:36 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
