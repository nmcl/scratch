Meanwhile, young lovers Drew (Diego Boneta) and Sherrie (Hough) fight to keep their love on track as they chase their dreams in the big city. The film features music by 1980s rock acts including Def Leppard, Foreigner, Journey and Poison.</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-01</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2014-01-01 19:22 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
