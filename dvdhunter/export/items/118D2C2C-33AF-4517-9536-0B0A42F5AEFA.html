</strong>There is greatness in a film that can be discussed, dissected, and talked about late into the night. Then there is genius that is right in front of our faces--you smile at the spell it puts you into and are refreshed, and not a word needs to be spoken. This kind of entertainment is what they used to call "movie magic" and there is loads of it in this irresistible computer animation feature. Just a picture of these bright toys on the cover of Toy Story looks intriguing as it reawakens the kid in us. Filmmaker John Lasseter's shorts illustrate not only a technical brilliance but also a great sense of humour--one in which the pun is always intended. Lasseter thinks of himself as a storyteller first and an animator second, much like another film innovator, Walt Disney. Lasseter's story is universal and magical: what do toys do when they're not played with? Cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Andy's favourite bedroom toy, tries to calm the other toys (some original, some classic) during a wrenching time of year--the birthday party, when newer toys may replace them. Sure enough, Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is the new toy that takes over the throne. Buzz has a crucial flaw, though--he believes he's the real Buzz Lightyear, not a toy. Bright and cheerful, <em>Toy Story</em> is much more than a 90-minute commercial for the inevitable bonanza of Woody and Buzz toys. Lasseter further scores with perfect voice casting, including Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn as a meek dinosaur. The director-animator won a special Oscar "For the development and inspired application of techniques that have made possible the first feature-length computer-animated film". In other words, this movie is great. --<em>Doug Thomas</em></p><p class="itemField"><strong>Languages: </strong>English; English; Danish; Greek; Hebrew; Norwegian</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Subtitles: </strong>Danish; English; Greek; Norwegian</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Dvd Release: </strong>2000-11-06</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Acquired: </strong>2014-01-04</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Region: </strong>2</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Number Of Discs: </strong>1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Aspect Ratio: </strong>16:9 - 1.78:1</p><p class="itemField"><strong>Date Modified: </strong>2015-01-08 20:31 +0000</p><br class="cleared" /></div>
